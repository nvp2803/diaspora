Example text go here: HTML is really a very simple language.  It consists of ordinary text, 
with commands that are enclosed by "&lt;" and "&gt;" characters, or 
bewteen an "&amp;" and a ";". <p>
You don't really need to know much HTML to create a page, because you 
can copy bits of HTML from other pages that do what you want, then 
change the text!</p><p>
This page shows on the left as it appears in your browser, and the 
corresponding HTML code appears on the right.  The HTML commands are 
linked to explanations of what they do.
</p><h3>Line Breaks</h3>
HTML doesn't normally use line breaks for ordinary text.  A white space 
of any size is treated as a single space.  This is because the author of
 the page has no way of knowing the size of the reader's screen, or what
 size type they will have their browser set for.<p>
If you want to put a line break at a particular place, you can use the 
"&lt;BR&gt;" command, or, for a paragraph break, the "&lt;P&gt;" 
command, which will insert a blank line.  The heading command 
("&lt;H4&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;") puts a blank line above and below the heading 
text.
</p><h4>Starting and Stopping Commands</h4>
Most HTML commands come in pairs: for example, "&lt;H4&gt;" marks the 
beginning of a size 4 heading, and "&lt;/H4&gt;" marks the end of it.  
The closing command is always the same as the opening command, except 
for the addition of the "/".<p>
Modifiers are sometimes  included along with the basic command, inside 
the opening command's &lt; &gt;.  The modifier does not need to be 
repeated in the closing command.
